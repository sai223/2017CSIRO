# 2017CSIRO
Tensorflow Slim Project in 2017 Summer Vacation at CSIRO

These python files are for working with TF-Slim
You should work with "https://github.com/tensorflow/models"
Put those code in directory models/slim

You can easily classify images with TF-Slim and these code.
Before that, I recommend to read "CPS-2.HowtouseTF-Slim-230817-1538-20" first
